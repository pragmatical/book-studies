# Week 10 — Evaluation and Optimization of MAS

**Source plan:** `study-group/study-plan-details.md` (Week 10)

## Outcome (artifact)

A 5-task evaluation suite + scoring rubric.

Capture the evaluation suite anywhere convenient (doc/whiteboard/notes) and share the link with the group.

## Reading

- Chapter 10
- Chapter 11: Sections 11.2–11.3

## Baseline exercise (20 min): Build an evaluation suite

### Step 1 — Brainstorm tasks (5 min)

List 10 candidate tasks that represent your target domain.

### Step 2 — Select 5 tasks (5 min)

Pick tasks that are:

- representative
- feasible to run repeatedly
- measurable

### Step 3 — Define scoring (10 min)

For each task define:

- success criteria (binary checks)
- usefulness score (1–5)
- format/schema requirements

Template:

```text
Task:
Input:
Expected output shape:

Binary checks:
-

Usefulness rubric (1–5):
- 1:
- 3:
- 5:
```

## Stretch exercise (optional, 10–20 min): Judge design

Design two scoring approaches:

- rule-based (schemas, regex, required sections)
- LLM-as-judge (rubric-based)

Write pros/cons and where each might be misleading.
