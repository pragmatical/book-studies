# Week 5 — UX Principles for Multi-Agent Systems

**Source plan:** `study-group/study-plan-details.md` (Week 5)

## Outcome (artifact)

A usability review checklist for agentic UX + one improvement proposal.

Capture the checklist anywhere convenient (doc/whiteboard/notes) and share the link with the group.

## Reading

- Chapter 3

## Baseline exercise (20 min): Score a flow using the 4 UX principles

Pick one target:

- an internal tool
- a popular AI product flow
- a hypothetical “agent that does X”

Score each category 1–5 and justify in one sentence.

Template:

```text
Product/flow:

1) Capability discovery (1–5):
- Evidence:

2) Cost-aware action delegation (1–5):
- Evidence:

3) Observability & provenance (1–5):
- Evidence:

4) Interruptibility (1–5):
- Evidence:

Top 2 UX failure modes:

One quick win (should fit in 1–2 sprints):

```

## Stretch exercise (optional, 10–20 min): Instrumentation sketch

Sketch what you would log/trace to support the UX principles:

- user intent
- tool calls (inputs/outputs)
- decisions (why an agent chose an action)
- stop reasons

Write “minimum viable observability” as 5 bullet events.
