# Session 0 — Preface (Kickoff Mini-Session)

This is a short session intended to run during the kickoff meeting.

## Goal for this mini-session

Align on what we’re doing and how we’ll work together:

- why we’re reading this book
- what “agents” and “multi-agent systems” mean in practice
- what success looks like for participants

## Reading (optional)

- Preface

## Baseline exercise (10 min): Preface alignment

### 1) Silent skim + highlight (3 min)

Everyone skims the Preface and writes down:

- 1 sentence you agree with
- 1 sentence you want to challenge

### 2) Round-robin share (5 min)

Each person shares (30–45s):

- their “agree” sentence
- their “challenge” sentence

Scribe captures:

- common themes
- disagreements worth revisiting

### 3) Decide “how we’ll run” (2 min)

As a group, pick defaults:

- reading is optional vs expected
- how we capture notes (any shared doc is fine)
- how we resolve disagreements (timebox + decision + revisit)

## Stretch (optional, 5 min): Personal goal + boundary

Each person writes (and optionally shares):

- one skill they want to build (e.g., eval, orchestration, UX, safety)
- one boundary (e.g., “no production automation without approvals”)
